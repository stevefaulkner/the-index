      <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Web Platform specifications an be available in one of three states:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>master</dt>
        <dd>
          For a given specification, the content of the master branch corresponds to technology that
          has been shown to be stable and interoperable, through testing. This does not mean that it
          is perfect. A specification can be merged into master whenever there are 1) roughly enough
          tests to get a good feel for how well something works, 2) roughly enough of them pass in a
          few implementations. These points are deliberately fuzzy. The idea is that there should not
          be a strict levels for any of those aspects as those tend to lead people to aim for the
          level rather than think about what's good for the project. This is meant to be a
          judgement call.
        </dd>
        <dt>develop</dt>
        <dd>
          The develop branch is the branch into which proposals are integrated, and which is then used
          to produce master when testing is sufficient. A proposal can be merged into develop when
          there is clear implementation interest (as exemplified by a couple of implementers starting
          actual work to support the proposal). As for master, merging a proposal into develop is
          meant to be a judgement call.
        </dd>
        <dt>proposals</dt>
        <dd>
          Here, anything goes. There can be many proposals for a given specification, and some might
          be completely crazy. That is okay, it is meant to be an area for creativity.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Specifications get added to this document through pull requests. The full approach is
        described in <a href='/project/'>the project documentation</a>.

          Each specification listed here follows the same template outlined below.

  &lt;p&gt;
    This specification is a permanent example of how a WebSpec is made.
